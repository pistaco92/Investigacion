Sou, that anwers one of my question. the reason why the people can be bad (or the mayority of deems) its not for a lack of identification of the evil, concomitant with a lack of a moral response.
the focus of the investiguetion have to center in the forms of that people gestionate their guilty. or why they filt shame instead. etcetera.
