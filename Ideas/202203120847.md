I thing that the fact of "conscience" add a whole new dimention.
in one side, we have people who recognice himself as good person but in stric rigor, they do constanly evil, but they are inconsly of quality of their acts.

and in the other side, people who considerate himself as trash. and, her i notice two direvates

1. dont do anything about it. simply chargues with the inner melancholy. and their acts actually match with their image.
2. theire are a inconsisty. because in spyte of their self-image. they actually are tring (behavihoral speaking) do his best. and they are really thing that are bad people? because the mode that they act with good person, delate that they care about that type of values and also, they are capable of *identiificate* the good. sou... what in fucked? they make a exception for himself? or because in parallel of they good act, they make evil acts that they are consiencly and that its enogh to maintein their distorcionate image? sou, the evil and the good are concomitants... VERY INTERESTING.
3. also in the sense of the intencetion
