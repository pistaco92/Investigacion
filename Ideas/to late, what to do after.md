Sou, in one point you can realiace that its evil. what happend in that moment? starts the guilt. you can redimate yourself and be a better person (Resilent answer). 

Case with the movie of the guy who bullly a blind person, hi wants to kill herself 
Case of the military. he reffuse to take a weapon is his life and have a perenme self despreciation

or there is a way when only you accept your evil nature and you consciensly dedicate to that? i never see a case like that btw.
