The topic of the hiprocresy its very interinting. in the mean of, your words, dont actually reflects your behaviur. sou, a thing that its tacit implicit. have a moral education (content) or not, influence in anything. the other mean its the fact that you can do good action that have intrinsical honored value. and in the same time do a evil action that, semantly moral speaking, its compleatly contradictory

the first ask that going in my mind, there are intencionaly hiprocretys? because i thing in 3 alternatives

1. They simplely dont do the association for a ignote reason
2. They consciensly do the omition of justament, enter in the category of lyers
3. They are inconsly, but for a contraatack resource
	1. The racionalization
	2. The inhibitation of freud
