I like to thing about it the argument of the identification (bad people interact with people equally bad). because i disaggry. based in my impiria. there is not relation betwend what you consly perciby from yourself and what group you chose. more prescly, the distintion its, what do you search, the ideals, in simply words; what do you morally *cares*. determinate the type of people with you interact

(
Example: tamara constantly searching and defending good guys in spite of considerate herself as a "miserable". my theory to the respect its because she intrinsecal intent to do good.
