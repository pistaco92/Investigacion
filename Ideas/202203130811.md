Sou, i have a theory, the reason why low-stemm individuals are vulnerable its not because their self-image persee. more presisly, the mechanism that put them in that state in first place: the shame. because that emotional response always have to see with a bad evaluation with the self. sou, in the long run, you end with a poor self-image. and forst worst you preponderant emotional response dont allow to do anything to improve, condenate to always atack. a nagative spiral.
