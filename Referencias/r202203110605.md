The introducction talks me about the whole estructure of the book. being in said. its a specy a compendium of all differents authors talking about the evil.
first part start of what are the actual perspectives of evil, do a litle review of the all different definition from that sort. he its in contra with the posture of incapsulate person in "evil guys" and "good guys" because this binary logic assume that the first are purely intrinsecal in their nature and dont have anything to see with us. and also that the secund below any circunstance can take the other path, sou, creates a <cesgo>. a moral superiority that dont permits us to realice if whe are doing evil. 
	
Sou, more that a analisis of a prefix pesonality. he centrate in circunstancial fact, in the nature mechanism that all have, and the basic emotion and humans deed that potencionaly can turn people like you and me in evil perpetror.
	
In another chapter, he talk about the human deeds, in the other, the ambiroments issues. the agression model, for a general theory. and in the last place, talk about empathy, their benefith, potencialy consecuenes, and that havet dont necesary means that you are safe of the hands of the evil influences.
