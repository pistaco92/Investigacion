[[The moral judjament of the child]]
- the notion of justice
	- for equality
- the liyers focus in the punishment beyond the moral rule persee
- the kids are capable of seing the practical utility of the values
- good is obey, evil its desoybeid
- what about being kind?
	(i guess that have to see with the transmutation of the moral view thoghard simpaty)
- the child leving a pass break of a rule because its for the beneficial of a tercerary.
