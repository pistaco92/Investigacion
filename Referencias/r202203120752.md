[[The social phycology of good and evil]]
A interesting concept its the scalation, that you gradually do more evil. a thing that i dont understand, scalate in consecuence of what? in the sense that you embote from percibing acts like evil and start doing more? or in the sense of revenge? 

(
	I thing in multiple examples. one is the cool war, the armamestic run. 
	The other sense its in the increasy of sensibilty. for example in the case that you take damage from one person, and you revenge in consecuence, you will be preperate for a contraatack, and that makes you sensible. Neurotic personality
)

The thing of the identification with groups. if you have the image of a bad person you can in principle being identificate with that type of group.
