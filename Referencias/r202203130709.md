[[The social phycology of good and evil]]
In the way i end the chapter i realilce that the holoscauts its not a experiment, its a history event. (xd). very interesting the point that instead of focus in the intrinsecal tendency to obedecy in the human nature. he focus in a colective tendency to obey that its charactesistic of their time. the cultural context. brillant. 
point of view from psycology.
