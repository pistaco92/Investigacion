[[The social phycology of good and evil]]
The relation betwend personal traits and the actual behaviur.
Sou, for what i understand, previsuly to a experiment they do a questionary about they dispocisition to honesty. and the more who point a high score stadistis speaking cheat less.

(
	This is complety contradictory to the other study of evil, that he said explictly that there is actualy not relashionship betwend the perspective and the actual behavior
)
	(No. because depend, if the questionaty its obsyusly related, can be a pollution. but if the questionaty in a indirect way evaluate honesty trait, can be more genuine)

(
	Comparate with other studys and see whats is say in detail
)

sou, they focus in exogenos factors. the other interesting point its the fact that the person who score high in responsability trait have  more less tendency to guilt another person to their mistake in obedence.

what exactly say...? that the more responsablity have the more guilt asume or you are more capable for follow your own orders?
