Ambiguety in the sense of not knowking exactly if what you are doing its the right. there is a relation with the aprobal. because if the perpetror dont recibe any type of repulsion for their act they dont have know that they are doing are wrong. or unless dont have moral arguments to stop doing. the silence in the villan mind its a signal of aprobbal. 
Put a case of a mother who intencionally manipulate other arounds her to camuflage the fact that she is being violent with his child. in that way, she never realice that her are the actual abyect person. because all take silence. 
The reason why anywhone denunces violent mothers its because there is so much risk of doing. unlest in the case of a empleyor of a institution, he can really have troubles. 
its very extrange thay anywhone do semejant action only for the seek of good...
