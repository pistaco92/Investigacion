[[The moral judjament of the child]]
- justice betwend the childs
- the initial type of justice its maintening in the future
	(this is usefull for me)
- the most summice declaine to punish back
	- defenseless in development
	(there will be a correlation with defenselesss sense? but in that case dont have more sense be proclive to the secound option?)
- the most anxyus ones are proclive to justice
- with the madurance, the punish become more iguality
	- Unless in the context of interpersonal conflicts
- Social punishment
	- Hate for more abusives ones
	- Restablish the order
