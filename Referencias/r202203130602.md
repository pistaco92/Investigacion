[[The social phycology of good and evil]]
talk about the experiment of the holocaus and other m (i dont know exactly the name). they are high controversial because are circunstancial based more that personality or moral traits. sou, open the pandora box that the men its evil for his own nature. 
Talk about the absolute obedence to the liders in the holocaus. and that its exactly the controversial fact, that people are capable of doing extreme evil if its puting in a equal presion for doint it. also, the definition of violence here its the extreme form of agression, murders, mass killing, events of wars, etcetera.

(
