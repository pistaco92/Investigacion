[[The moral judjament of the child]]

- The nocion of justice depending of the fathers
- the notion of inmediate justice its destinate to perish
	- early in high intelectual and violent origins
	- that mentality in the adults in spite of the empiria
- Instead:
	- the equality
	- the equitative
		- trait different depend of the subject
		- preference by the olders, in the seek of colaboration
			(i dont know if it is because start to seek for a more transcendt goal, instead of the mundal revenge)
	- the retriative
- justice its product of:
	- the own injustice sufferr
		- from the world or the fathers
	- father scrupulosos
- disoaciate the idea of rewards and punishment of altruist and egoistim.
	- this is a constructing of criance, its not the ideal
