[[The moral judjament of the child]]

- Reject of the of the child from revenge
	- forgivness
- Epistemologi roots of development of justice
- Ideal vs practical
- cheating by cheating back
- Justice its result of autonomy
	(can explain why the more abandonente ones have that type of mentality)
	(the mere education its not enofht)
	(and also i think that can happen if there is not authority to protect, sou their protect for his own)
	(but its contradictory of what the book tell afterwars, i dont know, i just follow the contrary reasoning that the child use for not revenge
	"call to the authorithis"
	)
- relation betwend love and justice? are conceptually excluyent?
	(i like to give a seperate review, its strong)
- Sintesis
	- Obidence
	- 2?
	- 3?
	- Social crimes
- "In conclucision"
	- the relation betwend madurance and the justice
	- proclive to reciprocrity
- equality in authority sense (favorate the stronger ones)
	(can have relation with the personality i investigate, becose the more crueltys have a jerarquy mentality)
(when its the transition from reciprocity justice to noble sentiments???
	ten years
	how and why?
	for i read, in the start of he integrate in adult sociaty, and the revenge its not longer allowed or rentable.
