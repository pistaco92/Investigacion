	yes, the guilt, if you take the faulght, you be more proclive to compesate. that souds like the duty concept.
	- relation with good below durkeim theory
		- context when there are stick concepts
	- the obligation of doing the good
		- adult presure
			(its enoght?)
	- what implicates the good by definition
		- if all doit, its concept gone
		(also i thinking from the perspective of free desicition)
	(i think that is the definition that i am seaching when i thing in moral compulsion)
- false equilibrium moral
	(sou, the moral its not introyect only by the habit. )
- persepctive points in sociaty
	- the moral as a collective habit
	(intrinsecal voluntary habit i think its more precisly)
	- or different moral, but can be concomitant
	(the inadecuate have to be the patologic ones)
- the authority moral
	- contributate develop the self
		(its uselfull for my section of the undevelop personality)
		i think that its because introyect the provisional morality.
