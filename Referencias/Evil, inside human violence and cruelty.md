#Titulo 
The book talk about the evil in a perspective of a force that can be in all of us depending of the circunstance. if i define in one way, its whe have a naturally predisposition to cruelty, but in the develoment (or the sociaty) put barriers to it. 

In the first part talk about perspectives of evil
the secoud part talk about the causes that anywhone can have to do a ruin act. The revenge, very interesting, make a relation with death penalty. the egoist. in here i can split in two categoris. the narcissism mood, that they dont care at all the other person, and the high-steem configuration. that impulse the individual to atack other in the seek of protect their unestable and unrealiveble (in the sense of sintonice with the reality) self-image. The pride and the relation with the public. 
The empathy conconmitant with the identification with groups. The hiper-moral as a evil. in here talk more from a nationalistic perspective, but also can be reduced to the individual resolution. In short word, dont permits a correct negociation because the moral aislate the group. and even worst that searching evil persee because the scrupulos have a intence influence in the individual, that normally its not in their rational control. 
Use evil as a intrument for searching other goal.
A whole section talk about the social issues involucrates. 


The badass idiosincratic, for impuse respect
