he try Yo recule the problem of have a lot of dependency
nightmare in the code, because Recoult in A dificult Yo change, + thing that the loomer world demands A lot.

te propuse tour strategy:o

1) the fake Repocitory.is a "sucedaneo" of the real one, put the output, and
you can put A layer of The Real Repository (dot syntax:c), in That You can ignore mat at all. [[effective python]]. in That
look, show a more Technical apock, this is more pure code
faced. follow the rule of "Trice dependency" you have To
create The logic firat and this afterwards. Justin funtion. (i comet the error in my own code). in the example, you see how Abstract a database to just Returns the output data in the fake. how you do this without the production give you A error? maybe dont matter.
2) the domain patero we the domain language to actually have more control, simplicity, And
escalation. here the lenguaje hace real world Termo. te ortogonal from the Repository. for promovate the liberation of this, you estructue
the ecosystem in A way that The domain get tuit what needa to
pair the tert. i asume, that you Maiden in that to the point you feel satisfacción (pace the teat actually, that you do After). the catisfaccion term come from [[the organiced mind]]. you we the memory on your Computer To simulate external data (why not just A Jon? Become me back to the same, depend on external, and its easy to setup). i can use the pillow library that:
discover in [[Automating boring stuff]],
you can give you the luge of suport on
the basal library (why mention A falacy respect to that?).

3) the tert unit
you Teil in a isolate manera, and follow the directriz of
tert vente find. Types of Toit: feature, end-to-end, integration, output. (i am not sure About) : guess that to the way he
mention separate the what from the how. And the Ted put limits of how much fake you have To create. the borderline.
4) The unit of work.
create service that carril all the dependency. you have A
A whole estructure That contain The Techint. and you put ☑ Aldarion (ap penas one for e-ntity) that give a triendy meaning.
