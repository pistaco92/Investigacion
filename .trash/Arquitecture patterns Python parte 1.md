he try Yo recule the problem of have a lot of dependency
nightmare in the code, because Recoult in A dificult Yo change, + thing that the businnes  world demands A lot.
four strategy
1) the fake Repocitory.is a "sucedaneo" of the real one, put the output, and
you can put A layer of The Real Repository (dot syntax:c), in That You can ignore at all. [[effective python]]. in That
look, show a more Technical aproch, this is more pure code
faced. follow the rule of "inverse dependency" you have To
create The logic first  and the  afterwards. just in funtion. (i comet the error in my own code). in the example, you see how Abstract a database to just Returns the output data in the fake. how you do this without the production give you A error? maybe dont matter.
2) the domain pattern we the domain language to actually have more control, simplicity, And
escalation. here the lenguaje have a real world exapmple. the ortogonal from the Repository. for promovate the liberation of this, you estructue
the ecosystem in A way that The domain get what needs to
do the test. i asume, that you do the logic to the point you feel satisfacción (pace the test actually, that you do After). the satisfacction term come from [[the organiced mind]]. you we the memory on your Computer To simulate external data (why not just A json? Become me back to the same, depend on external, and its easy to setup). i can use the pillow library that:
discover in [[Automating boring stuff]],
you can give you the luge of suport on
the basal library (why mention A falacy respect to that?).

3) the test unit
you Teil in a isolate manera, and follow the directriz of
tert vente find. Types of Toit: feature, end-to-end, integration, output. (i am not sure About) : guess that to the way he
mention separate the what from the how. And the Ted put limits of how much fake you have To create. the borderline.
4) The unit of work.
create service that carril all the dependency. you have A
A whole estructure That contain The Techint. and you put ☑ Aldarion (ap penas one for e-ntity) that give a triendy meaning.
